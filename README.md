# library-management-system
📚 Library Management System (SQL Project)
✨ Project Overview
This project is a Library Management System built using SQL.
It handles the management of books, branches, employees, members, book issuance and returns, overdue tracking, and reporting — all through structured queries and stored procedures.

The system is developed using PostgreSQL and PL/pgSQL for procedural logic.

🎯 Objective

Design a relational database for library operations.
Ensure data integrity using constraints and relationships.
Perform CRUD operations efficiently.
Write complex SQL queries for reporting and insights.
Automate workflows with stored procedures.
Generate branch and employee performance reports.

🛠️ Key Features

📖 Manage book inventory, availability, and rentals.
🏢 Manage library branches and their employees.
🙋 Register and manage library members.
📚 Issue and return books with tracking.
⏰ Monitor overdue books.
⚡ Use stored procedures for book issuance and returns.
📊 Generate reports on revenue, activity, and performance.
🧱 Technologies Used

PostgreSQL (Database)

PL/pgSQL (Procedural Language for SQL)

📂 Project Structure
Section	Description

📌 Conclusion
This project successfully simulates a real-world library system using pure SQL.
It demonstrates how SQL can be used beyond simple data storage — to create complex workflows, automate operations, and generate meaningful business insights.

Key learnings include:

Best practices in database design and normalization.
Developing efficient SQL queries for real-world scenarios.
Using procedures to automate and streamline database operations.
Building a solid foundation for scalable, production-ready database applications.
This project can easily be expanded into larger systems such as inventory management, school libraries, or corporate resource libraries.
